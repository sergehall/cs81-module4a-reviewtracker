/**
 * Finds the most frequently read book in the reading log.
 *
 * Parameter:
 *   - log: array of objects with a `book` field (string)
 *
 * Returns:
 *   - title of the most read book (string), or null if none
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - This version tracks frequency and finds the max in one pass.
 *   - It uses a hash map (`bookCounts`) to count how many times each book appears.
 *   - During iteration, it updates both the count and checks if the current book
 *     has surpassed the previous max count â€” allowing us to track the most frequent
 *     book without a second pass.
 *   - Invalid entries (missing or non-string `book` fields) are skipped with a warning.
 *   - The function handles edge cases gracefully, such as non-array input or an empty log.
